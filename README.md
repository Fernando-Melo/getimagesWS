# [Arquivo.pt](http://arquivo.pt/): Prototype Search Image
Web service rest extracted from the [OpenSearch](https://github.com/arquivo/pywb-opensearch-cdx) webpage harvested. Then, it collects from the sites parametrizable number of images of each page, assigning each image a score for the final ranking. It also uses the [CDXServer](https://github.com/ikreymer/pywb/wiki/CDX-Server-API) to verify that the resource was well indexed.
